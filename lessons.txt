to annotate computer systems and define its structure and text.

between the opening and closing tags of an element.

List Item Element
-Lists must first be identified by parent elements being either
<ol> or <ul>
-The <li> list item element create list items inside:

Video Element
The <video> element embeds a media player into an HTML document for video playback.
The src attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display
video controls in the media player.

Note: <video> element can contain text content between its opening and closing tags which will be
displayed if the browser does not support the video format or if the video fails to load.

VIDEO ELEMENT EX:
<video src="test-video.mp4" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>

<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>

-After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are
used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser.
-The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic
video controls: pause, play and skip.

Emphasis Element
The <em> emphasis element emphasizes text and browsers will usually italicize the emphasized text
by default.

EMPHASIS EX:
<p>This <em>word</em> will be emphasized in italics.</p>

Styling Text:
-The <em> tag will generally render as 'italic' emphasis

-The <strong> will generally render as 'bold' emphasis

Breaking a line(enter)
-modifying or spacing in the browser is called
the line break element: <br>
-Unique due to only having an opening tag
-Basically just hits enter to your text

Adding Images:
-The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web
page
-It is a self closing tag meaning it has a / in its opening
tag
-the <img> tag requires an attribute called src. The src attribute
must be set to the image's source, or the location of the image.
-src must be set to the images source or uniform resource locator (URL)
-<img src="image-location.jpg" />

Image Alts:
-the alt attribute which means alternative text brings meaning to the images
on sites
-the alt attribute can be added to the image tag just like the src attribute
-The value of alt should be a description of the image
-Must be as accurate and sufficiant as possibe. Short n Sweet
-<img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />

More on Alts:
-If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area
originally intented for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is
made possible by the description you provide in the alt attribute.

-Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software.
When you include the alt attribute, the screen reading software can read the image's
description out loud to the visually impaired user.

**
-The alt attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO),
because search engines cannot "see" the images on websites as they crawl the internet.
Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.
**

-if image does not have meaningful info, the alt attribute should be left empty.

them.

-<p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.

-The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
